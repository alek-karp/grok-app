/**
 * Seed script: Priyanshu (425-560-6921).
 *
 * Populates a realistic demo history for one patient:
 *   1. Upserts the user (so phone → stable patient id resolves on the dashboard).
 *   2. Writes ~90 days of daily KPI rows that read as "mostly healthy, with a
 *      light, gradual trend toward cognitive decline" — gentle downward drift on
 *      the memory/language signals plus day-to-day noise, never a crash.
 *   3. Implants long-term memories (supermemory) painting an elderly, somewhat
 *      senile man — life details plus the kind of forgetful moments a daily
 *      check-in would accumulate over months.
 *
 * Run:  bun run scripts/seed-priyanshu.ts
 * (bun auto-loads .env.local, so DATABASE_URL + SUPERMEMORY_* are available.)

  "His late wife was named Meera; she passed a few years ago. He speaks about her warmly and sometimes, mid-conversation, talks as if she is still in the next room.",
  "He has a son, Arjun, who lives a couple of hours away and visits on weekends. Priyanshu occasionally calls Arjun by his younger brother's name, Vinod, and then corrects himself with a laugh.",
  "He keeps a tabby cat named Simba who sleeps on the windowsill. The cat is one of his favourite things to talk about.",
  "He loves cricket and old Hindi film songs from the 1960s and 70s. He can sing long stretches of lyrics from decades ago even on days he struggles with recent events.",
  "He grows tomatoes and chillies in his back garden and is proud of them, though lately he sometimes forgets whether he has watered them and waters twice.",
  "Over the last couple of months he has more often lost track of what day of the week it is, and has asked during the call what day it is more than once.",
  "He frequently misplaces his reading glasses and his keys, and has mentioned searching the house for them. They are often on his own head or in his pocket.",
  "He sometimes forgets he has already eaten breakfast and will mention making tea and toast a second time in the same morning.",
  "He repeats favourite stories — especially one about meeting Meera at a wedding in Pune — often within the same conversation, not remembering he just told it.",
  "He is usually warm and cheerful on calls, but has flatter, quieter days where he is slower to find words and reaches for 'the thing, you know the thing' before landing on a word.",
  "He is generally good about taking his morning blood-pressure pill after breakfast, but on some days recently he wasn't sure whether he had taken it.",
  "He mentioned once that he stood in the kitchen and couldn't remember why he had walked in, which worried him a little.",
  "He enjoys talking to Cora and looks forward to the morning calls; he says the house is quiet and it's nice to hear a friendly voice.",
  "He still does the newspaper crossword most mornings but says it takes him longer than it used to, and he leaves more of it unfinished than before.",
